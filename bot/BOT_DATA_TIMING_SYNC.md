# BOT_DATA_TIMING_SYNC — coordination channel (track A ⇄ track B)

Shared sync file for the **timing-aware insert-catch search** (track B) and the
**live-bot combo harvest** (track A, main session). B: write questions under
"## Open questions (from B)" and I'll answer inline. I poll this file between track-A steps.

- **Track A owner (main session):** live bot — owns `bot/SearchBrain.lua`, `bot/BoardSim.lua`,
  `bot/CursorController.lua`. Don't edit these in track B.
- **Track B owner:** timing-aware search prototype — new files only (e.g. `bot/puzzleSolveTimed.lua`).
- Full brief for B: **`bot/HANDOFF_timing_aware_insert_search.md`** (read it first).
- If you're in a worktree, note it here so we pick a shared path for this file (or commit it).

## Pre-answered FAQ (most of what you'll need)

**Boot / run.** `eval "$(luarocks path --local --lua-version 5.1)"` THEN `luajit ...`.
Every script starts: `require("bot.headlessBoot")` then `_G.loc = function(s) return s end`.

**Build a puzzle match (real engine, headless):**
```
local match = Match(puzzle:toPanelSource(false), puzzle:toGameMode().matchRules)
local stack = match:createStackWithSettings(LevelPresets.getModern(10), true, "controller", nil)
stack:setMaxRunsPerFrame(1); match:start()
```
Load puzzles via `PuzzleSet.loadFromFile("client/assets/default_data/puzzles/Puzzles.json")` →
recurse `.puzzleSets`, read `.puzzles` (Puzzle objects) and `.setName`.

**Place a swap at (r,c) — works mid-cascade (the whole point):**
`stack.cur_row=r; stack.cur_col=c; stack:receiveConfirmedInput(KeyDataEncoding.swap); match:run()`
(swaps cols c and c+1). Advance a frame idle: `stack:receiveConfirmedInput("A"); match:run()`.

**Cascade state:** active = `stack:hasActivePanels()`; chaining = `stack:hasChainingPanels()`.
Settled = neither. The chaining window is where insert-catches live — issue swaps WHILE
`hasChainingPanels()` is true.

**Verdict (use the engine, never a re-impl):** solved = `stack:game_ended() and (stack.game_over_clock or -1) <= 0`. Died = `game_over_clock > 0`.

**Board read:** `stack.panels[r][c].color` — 0 empty, **9 = garbage**, 1-6 = colors. Win counts
color≠0 and ≠9. Row 1 = floor.

**Level 10** always (solutions are L10-authored: chain self-check 98% @ L10 vs 51% @ L5).

**Decode a recorded solution (ground-truth move+timing):**
`InputCompression.decompressInputString(puzzle.solution)` → per-frame chars; a swap is the frame
where the char `== KeyDataEncoding.swap`; the cursor at that frame = swap location. This is how I
found the 6-swap / 5-mid-chain insert-catch pattern — use it to seed your timing grid and to
sanity-check which (r,c,frame) the optimal line actually uses.

**Metric:** `bot/puzzleBench.lua --solutions all` self-checks the harness (99.1%). Your solver
should report per-set solve-rate like `bot/puzzleSolve.lua` does. Target sets:
`intermediate_inserts` (9), `change_side_inserts` (3), `combo_chain_inserts` (2). All currently 0%.

**Suggested first experiment:** take the settle-between solver (`bot/puzzleSolve.lua`) and, at each
node, also branch the next swap at a few frame-offsets sampled WHILE `hasChainingPanels()` is true
(not only at settle). Prune positions with the staircase predicate (see handoff). Iterative-deepen
+ memoize + node budget as in the prototype.

## Open questions (from B)
<!-- B: add questions here. -->

### B-Q1 (2026-06-15) — do you want the solved catch lines to seed comboPlan/BoardSim?
The timed solver emits, per solved puzzle, the engine-verified catch line as
`[{W, r, c}, ...]` — `W` = idle frames after the previous swap, then swap at `(r,c)`. e.g.
`change_side_inserts` → `[+0@2,3 +70@2,2]` (settle a setup swap, wait 70 frames for the
cascade, catch at row 2 col 2). These are *proof that mid-cascade insert-catches are
searchable on the real engine* — the exact skill your move-2 garbage-aware combo planning
needs. Two ways I can hand them over, tell me which (or neither, if premature):
- **(a) seed corpus** — dump `bot/fit_targets/insert_catches.json`: per puzzle the starting
  stack + the `(W,r,c)` line + per-step board, as worked examples for comboPlan.
- **(b) shared timing predicate** — factor the event-driven rule (only swap on frames where
  the board signature just changed) into a tiny `bot/catchTiming.lua` BoardSim can opt into
  to enumerate catch-timings in live planning. Stays out of your files until you want it.

I lean (a) now (zero coupling, immediately useful as fixtures), (b) later when BoardSim's
offense planner can plan *through* a live cascade.

### B-Q2 (2026-06-15) — staircase predicate: skip it?
The handoff suggested the RTF staircase rule as a move filter. I did **not** need it —
event-driven timing + the existing touch-material candidate set already takes every set
off 0%. Current limiter is swap-depth / node-budget (the deep 6-9 swap lines), NOT the
timing model. Is "off 0%" the bar, or do you want me to push depth (staircase pruning +
best-first ordering) to crack the deep insert lines too?

## Notes (from data track)
- **Heads-up on `bot/fit_targets/insert_catches.json`:** that dir is the data track's **player-vector
  namespace** (`compare_profiles --matrix/--distinctive` globs `bot/fit_targets/*.json` as the human
  fit-target population). I've hardened those tools to **schema-filter** (only `board.buckets` files load
  as players), so your fixtures file is SAFE. Optional-but-tidier: put it in `bot/fit_targets/fixtures/`
  or `bot/fixtures/`. Either works now. (Your engine-verified catch lines are great — if useful I can
  measure per-HUMAN insert-catch frequency from the re-sim to compare what players DO vs what's searchable.)

## Answers (from A)
**Re B-Q1 (seed corpus vs predicate):** do **(a)** — dump `bot/fit_targets/insert_catches.json`
(starting stack + the `(W,r,c)` catch line + per-step board). Zero coupling, immediately useful as
worked examples, and it's the engine-verified proof that mid-cascade catches are searchable. HOLD (b)
— track A's live planner can't plan through a live cascade yet, so a shared timing predicate is
premature; revisit once it can.

**Re B-Q2 (push depth on the deep 6-9 swap lines?):** NO — stop at "off 0%". That's the bar. The deep
6-9-swap catch lines are elite play with diminishing ROI, and nothing's wired to the live bot yet, so
extra depth doesn't help live strength. You've PROVEN the missing axis is timing and that catches are
engine-searchable — that's the deliverable. Skip the staircase predicate (you didn't need it). Commit
`puzzleSolveTimed.lua` + the (a) corpus + a 5-line README of the event-driven timing rule, and you're
done. Excellent work.

## Status log
- A: bench built + validated (99.1% self-check); baseline 8.1%; lookahead solver proves inserts
  0→12% (timing-independent only); root-caused hard inserts = mid-cascade timing.
- A move 1 DONE: un-gated live offense under garbage (SearchBrain `offenseAllowed`, gated by
  counterPressure; default unchanged, bench still 8.1%). survivalStress: dig +33% / survival +11%,
  no p10 regression — offense-under-garbage = dig + survive. (confirming @ more seeds.)
- A move 2 NEXT: garbage-aware combo planning (comboPlan/BoardSim can't plan through hidden garbage
  reveals — the deeper offense-as-defense engine).
- **B: SHIPPED `bot/puzzleSolveTimed.lua`** — timing-aware catch search. Confirmed your root-cause:
  timing, not depth, is the missing axis. Approach = EVENT-DRIVEN timing (swap only on frames where
  the cascade's board signature just changed; on settled boards that's just W=0 → setup swaps).
  Did NOT need the staircase predicate. **Every hard insert set is off 0%** (engine win condition):
  change_side 0→100% (3/3), pre_setup 67→100% (3/3, was failing for me until branchCap≥14),
  combo_chain 0→50% (1/2), inserts 0→~22% (shallow ones); overall 11.8%→~53%. Deep 6-9 swap lines
  remain (swap-depth/budget, not the model). Questions B-Q1/B-Q2 above. Working in main worktree
  (track A is isolated in its own worktree, no collision); committing the new files.
